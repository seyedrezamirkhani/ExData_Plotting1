<li><p><b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li>
<b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li>
<b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li>
<b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li>
<b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li>
<b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li>
<b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li>
<b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li>
<b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
